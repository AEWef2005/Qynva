This directory contains starter code and example implementations for the Qynva GPU framework.

## Structure

Examples should be organized by domain and complexity:
- `basic/` - Simple examples like vector addition, matrix multiplication
- `advanced/` - Complex examples showcasing framework capabilities
- `benchmarks/` - Performance benchmarking examples
- `tutorials/` - Step-by-step tutorial implementations

Similar to oneAPI's DirectProgramming/C++SYCL/ structure.
