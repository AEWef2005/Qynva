# Branching and Workflow Setup Complete

This document summarizes the Git Flow branching model that has been implemented for the Qynva repository.

## Branches Created

### 1. `main` Branch
- **Purpose**: Stable releases only
- **Status**: ✅ Created and configured
- **Protection**: Should be protected via GitHub settings (requires manual setup in GitHub)
- **Commit**: Contains the base project structure with CMake and documentation

### 2. `develop` Branch  
- **Purpose**: Integration branch for features
- **Status**: ✅ Created and configured
- **Usage**: All feature branches should be created from and merged back into `develop`
- **Commit**: Contains the same base structure as `main`

### 3. `feature/bio-tensor-opt` Branch (Example)
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates the feature branch workflow
- **Status**: ✅ Created with sample bio-tensor optimization feature
- **Pattern**: Shows how to create feature branches following `feature/<descriptive-name>` convention

## Project Structure Implemented

```
Qynva/
├── CMakeLists.txt              # CMake build configuration
├── .gitignore                  # C++ project gitignore rules
├── README.md                   # Complete documentation
├── BRANCHING_SETUP.md          # This file
├── include/qynva/              # Header files
│   ├── tensor.hpp              # Base tensor interface
│   └── bio_tensor.hpp          # Bio-tensor optimization (example)

└── tests/                      # Test directory (empty, ready for tests)
```

## GitHub Settings Required

To complete the setup, these GitHub repository settings need to be configured:

### Branch Protection for `main`
1. Go to repository Settings → Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch
3. Enable:
   - Require a pull request before merging
   - Require approvals (recommend 1+)
   - Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - Include administrators (optional but recommended)

## Commands for Developers

### Starting New Feature Work
```bash
# Switch to develop and pull latest changes
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch (replace 'your-feature-name' with descriptive name)
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Work on feature...
# Commit using conventional commit format:
git commit -m "feat: Add your feature description"

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create Pull Request in GitHub to merge into 'develop'
```

### Example Feature Branch Names
- `feature/bio-tensor-opt` (already created as example)
- `feature/helical-tensor-structure`
- `feature/optimization-algorithms`
- `feature/performance-improvements`

### Conventional Commit Examples
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add helical tensor structure implementation"
git commit -m "fix: Resolve memory leak in bio-tensor optimization"
git commit -m "docs: Update API documentation for tensor operations"
git commit -m "refactor: Simplify tensor calculation algorithm"
git commit -m "test: Add unit tests for bio-tensor optimization"
git commit -m "chore: Update CMake build configuration"
```

## Dependency Management

- ✅ CMake configured to fetch dependencies at build time
- ✅ `.gitignore` configured to exclude build artifacts and dependencies
- ✅ No binaries committed to repository
- ✅ FetchContent examples provided in CMakeLists.txt

## Build System Verification

The CMake build system has been tested and works correctly:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Setup Required**: Configure branch protection rules in GitHub Settings
2. **Team Onboarding**: Share this document and the README.md with team members
3. **CI/CD**: Consider setting up GitHub Actions for automated testing and building
4. **Merge Strategy**: When ready, merge `develop` into `main` for the first stable release

## Workflow Summary

```
main (protected) ←── develop ←── feature/bio-tensor-opt
                          ↑           feature/helical-tensor-structure
                          ↑           feature/your-next-feature
                          └─────── (merge via PR after review)
```

This setup ensures:
- Clean, reviewable history
- Stable main branch
- Organized feature development  
- Proper dependency management
- Semantic versioning through conventional commits
