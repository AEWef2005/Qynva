# Build Scripts

This directory contains build scripts and configuration for the Qynva GPU framework.

## Structure

- Cross-platform build configuration (CMakeLists.txt)
- Platform-specific build scripts
- Packaging and distribution scripts
- CI/CD build configurations

The build system should support multiple GPU backends (NVIDIA CUDA, AMD ROCm/HIP, Intel oneAPI/SYCL).
